# Early Polish manuscripts
A demo website built for training at IIIF course during DHSi2019 using __Wax__, "an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles.__<br>
It's comprised of: __a few Ruby gems__ for processing image data and associated metadata ([wax_tasks](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_tasks/), [wax_iiif](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_iiif/)), __a Jekyll theme__ ([wax_theme](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/)), and (hopefully soon!) a lot of __documentation and recipes__ for creating, deploying, and maintaining digital exhibitions."

This site's sample collection comprises a set of objects, each of which is represented by one or more images. The collection items in this demo are early Polish manuscripts, held by [Jagiellonian Library in Krak√≥w](https://jbc.bj.uj.edu.pl) and [Polona, digital section of National Library in Warsaw](polona.pl).
